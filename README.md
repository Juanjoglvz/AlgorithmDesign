## Dynamic Programming
Exercises to calculate something using dynamic programming:

- Combinatorial Number: Forward and backward methods
  - Calculated with Pascal's triangle:
   - combinatorial(n, k) = combinatorial(n-1, k-1) + combinatorial(n-1, k).

- Progression: Forward and backward methods
  - f(2n) = f(2n + 1)
  - f(2n + 1) = f(n) + f(n + 1)
  - f(1) = f(2) = 1
  
- Fibonacci number: Forward and backward methods

- Ackerman Function: Forward and backward methods

- Travelling salesperson: Forward and backward methods

## Probabilistic programming
Exercises to calculate something using different probabilistic methods:
  - calculate areas below different functions.
